# R for Statistics and Data Visualisation - An Introduction for Life Scientists
## Research and Innovation IT, University of Sheffield
#### Elizabeth Oladapo

The aim of this course is to give an introduction to using R programming language for analyzing data in RStudio, focusing on basic Statistics and Data Visualization.


###   Overview
The accelerated increase in the data generated from high-throughput scientific experiments has led to the need for people in academia and industry to upskill themselves with R programming language for manipulating and visualizing data. Thereby, making R an excellent programming languages to consider for data analysis.

R is a very competent programming language, it is a free,  open-sourced software for statistical analysis, with many useful features such as "Best-in-Class Visualizations", that are insightful and facilitate reproducible research.

At the end of this training, you should feel confident to start managing your own data, use packages and libraries in R, produce histograms, customize plots,  build and fit  models and perform statistical analyses
