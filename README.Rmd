###    Aim

The aim of this course is to provide an introductory overview of utilizing the R programming language within RStudio for data analysis, with a specific emphasis on basic statistics and data visualization. We assume that you have a grasp of data types and the ability to draw conclusions from data outcomes. Our objective here is to demonstrate how to employ R for data visualization and to instruct you in basic statistical techniques. Please note that we will not delve deeply into the appropriateness of data types for specific statistical methods or the various types of hypotheses that can be tested using these statistics.

<br/>

###   Overview

R stands out as a highly proficient programming language. It is a free and open-source software designed for statistical analysis, boasting a plethora of valuable features, including "Best-in-Class Visualizations" that offer insightful and reproducible research capabilities. The exponential growth in the volume of data generated by high-throughput scientific experiments has given rise to dependable tools like R for data processing, management, and visualization. Consequently, there's a growing demand in both academia and industry for individuals to enhance their proficiency in R programming to manipulate and visualize data effectively. This positions R as an exceptional programming language of choice for data analysis.

By the end of this training, you should feel self-assured in your ability to independently manage data, utilize R packages and libraries, create histograms, customize plots, construct and fit models, and perform statistical analyses.
