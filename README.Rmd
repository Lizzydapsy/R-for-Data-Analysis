###   Aim
The aim of this course is to give an introduction to using R programming language for analyzing data in RStudio, focusing on basic statistics and data visualization. It is assumed that you understand data types and be able to draw conclusions from data results. The goal here is to show you how to use R to visualize data and teach you some basic statistics. We will not be explaining in details the suitability of data types to various statistics and the types of hypothesis that can be tested with the different statistics. 

<br/>

###   Overview
R is a very competent programming language, it is a free,  open-sourced software for statistical analysis, with many useful features such as "Best-in-Class Visualizations", that are insightful and facilitate reproducible research.
The accelerated increase in the data generated from high-throughput scientific experiments has led to the need for people in academia and industry to upskill themselves with R programming language for manipulating and visualizing data. Thereby, making R an excellent programming languages to consider for data analysis.


At the end of this training, you should feel confident to start managing your own data, use packages and libraries in R, produce histograms, customize plots,  build and fit  models and perform statistical analyses

<br/>

### Training Schedule

<br/>

This course has been parted into two. The first section focuses on data visualization and the other one is mainly on basic statistics.
